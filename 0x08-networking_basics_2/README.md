## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is localhost/127.0.0.1
* What is 0.0.0.0
* What is /etc/hosts
* How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces

## Localhost
localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. The name localhost is reserved for loopback purposes.
It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.
