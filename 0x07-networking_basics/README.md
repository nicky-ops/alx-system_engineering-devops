## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### OSI Model
* What it is
* How many layers it has
* How it is organized
### What is a LAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
### What is a WAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
### What is the Internet
* What is an IP address
* What are the 2 types of IP address
* What is localhost
* What is a subnet
* Why IPv6 was created
### TCP/UDP
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

## OSI Model
Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual model from ISO that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection.
The communications between sytems are split into seven abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. Classes of functionality are realized in all software development through all standardized communication protocols.

## LANs, WANS
A local area network(LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
A Wide area Network(WAN) is a telecommunication network that extends over a large geographical area. and are often establilshed using leased telecommunication circuits.

## Internet
The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. 

## MAC address
A Media Access Controll(MAC) address is a string of characters that identifies a device on a network and is tied to a network interface card found in your computer.
Manufacturers assign a MAC address to a network adapter when it is produced. It is hardwired or hard-coded onto your computerâ€™s NIC and is unique to it. Something called the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) translates an IP address into a MAC address.

## Localhost
localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. The name localhost is reserved for loopback purposes.
It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.
