## OSI Model
Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual model from ISO that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection.
The communications between sytems are split into seven abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. Classes of functionality are realized in all software development through all standardized communication protocols.
